This demo contains two simple Android projects:

1. DialogFragmentDemo
A simple application using a dialog box implemented with a DialogFragment.
With this implementation try to rotate the device when the dialog box is displayed.
Compare with the DialogDemo application.

2. ShakespeareFragments
In this application the user interface is built from Fragments.
In a standard portrait view there is a ListView and TextView displayed in separate screens.
In landscape view both the ListView and TextView are displayed side by side (1/3 and 2/3 of
the screen) in the same activity.
